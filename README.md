# Credit Card Fraud Detection (CCFD)

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using decision tree algorithms. 
I will the voting system from scratch and will also use the scikit-learn library to provide a comparative analysis of both approaches.

In the future, i will also use other approaches such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines and logistic regression.

# Project Description

Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task for financial institutions to prevent financial losses and protect customers. 
This project uses machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions based on various features.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.
